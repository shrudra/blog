title: Top 2 most useful websites to share code
---


On social media platforms, many people, especially computer science students, copy and paste the code in comments or messages to share with others. For this reason, the indentation may not be correct. And some people share screenshots of the code. This makes the code look very bad. Sometimes, user can't read the code properly.

So there are numerous tools on the internet to share code. I have collected the names of two websites from among them and mentioned below.

1) <a href="https://paste.ubuntu.com">paste.ubuntu.com</a>

Using this website, you can easily share code. But for this, you must have to create an account. After, you have to paste the code and it's will be generate an URL. You can see your code visiting the generated URL. Through this website, you can highlight your codes. To highlight the codes correctly, you have to select a specific language.Personally, I like this site for sharing code with professional people.

2) <a href="https://pastie.org">pastie.org</a>

This is one of the best site for sharing code. You can also highlight your code here. However, there is a disadvantage, that is, the shared code will expire after 24 hours. I still like this site very much. I use this site to share code with my closest friends and classmates .
