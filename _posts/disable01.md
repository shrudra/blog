Automatic crop disease diagnosis using deep learning models has the potential to revolutionize the way farmers manage their crops. Currently, manual diagnosis can be time-consuming, requiring specialized knowledge and making it difficult for farmers to identify and treat diseases promptly. However, with the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), this process can be automated, providing an accurate and efficient solution.

In this research study, the objective is to develop and evaluate a deep learning model using the vision deep CNN approach for automatic crop disease diagnosis. The model aims to accurately diagnose crop diseases based on input images of affected areas and provide appropriate solutions.

The first step in this research is to collect a dataset of crop disease images from various sources, including online repositories and local farms. These images will be preprocessed to remove noise and enhance features using techniques such as histogram equalization and image resizing. The preprocessed images will then be split into training, validation, and test sets.

Next, a pre-trained CNN model, such as VGG16 or ResNet, will be used as a feature extractor to capture the most relevant features of the input images. The output of the pre-trained CNN model will be flattened and connected to a fully connected layer, which will act as a classifier to predict the disease type. The pre-trained CNN model will be fine-tuned by training it on our dataset to improve its performance on crop disease images.

Additionally, a combination of CNNs and RNNs will be used to capture the spatial and temporal dependencies of the input images. The output of the CNN model will be fed as input to the RNN model, which will then generate a sequence of disease names and corresponding solutions. The RNN model will be trained using a sequence-to-sequence model architecture such as the Encoder-Decoder model.

To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score will be used. Additionally, the performance of the model will be compared with existing state-of-the-art approaches for crop disease diagnosis.


In conclusion, this research study proposes the development and evaluation of a deep learning model for automatic crop disease diagnosis using a vision deep CNN approach. The proposed model has the potential to reduce the time and effort required for crop disease diagnosis, improve crop yields, and benefit farmers worldwide.
