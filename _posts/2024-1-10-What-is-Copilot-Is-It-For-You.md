# What is Copilot?

GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered code suggestion tool that helps developers write code faster. To use it, you should need an eligible subscription on GitHub, such as GitHub Pro, Team or Enterprise. Once you're subscribed, you can enable it in supported code editors like VS Code. You can install the Copilot extension in your supported code editor and sign in with your GitHub account.

# Is it for you?

GitHub Copilot can help beginners who are learning to code by showing examples and giving suggestions. But if you're newbie to coding and don't know any coding language, Copilot might be too advanced.

If you're just starting to learn, it's a good idea to begin with beginner-friendly coding classes or tutorials. While there are many websites to learn coding from, I suggest starting with w3schools.com.

Once you gain the basics of coding, Copilot can make learning easier and improve your coding skills.

So, Copilot best for people, who already know a little bit about coding. If you're a beginner, it's smart to start learn programming before trying out Copilot.
