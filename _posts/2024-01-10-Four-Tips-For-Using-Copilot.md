---

GitHub Copilot helps developers code better and faster. It uses AI to suggest ideas, making it a valuable tool for your coding work. It boosts productivity but works best when combined with your coding skills.

### 4 Important Tips to Using Copilot 

- **Understand Suggestions:** Take a moment to understand Copilot's suggestions, understand the suggested code. It's important to ensure the code match with your project.
  
- **Customize as Needed:** Copilot's suggestions might not always be perfect. Be ready to modify or write code manually when necessary. 

- **Feedback Loop:** Help Copilot get better by giving feedback—accept, adjust, or turn down suggestions.

- **Respect Code Ownership:** Copilot helps with code but doesn’t own it. Make sure you have the right permissions to use the code suggested by Copilot.

Happy Coding!
